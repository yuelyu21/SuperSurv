Implements the Double Super Learner framework for right-censored
survival data. Automatically constructs optimal convex combinations of
parametric, semi-parametric, and machine learning base learners to
minimize cross-validated risk using Inverse Probability of Censoring
Weights (IPCW). Features include high-dimensional variable screening
(Elastic Net, Marginal, Variance), automated hyperparameter tuning
grids, rigorous performance evaluation (Brier Score, Uno's C-index,
time-dependent AUC), and clinical calibration metrics. Provides robust
global and local interpretability for complex survival ensembles via
Kernel SHAP and time-dependent explanations.

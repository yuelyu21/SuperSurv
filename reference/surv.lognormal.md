# Parametric Survival Prediction Wrapper (Log-Normal)

Parametric Survival Prediction Wrapper (Log-Normal)

## Usage

``` r
surv.lognormal(time, event, X, newdata, new.times, obsWeights, id, ...)
```

## Arguments

- time:

  Observed follow-up time.

- event:

  Observed event indicator.

- X:

  Training covariate data.frame.

- newdata:

  Test covariate data.frame to use for prediction.

- new.times:

  Times at which to obtain the predicted survivals.

- obsWeights:

  Observation weights.

- id:

  Cluster identification variable.

- ...:

  Additional ignored arguments.

## Value

A list containing the fitted model and predictions.

## Examples

``` r
data("metabric", package = "SuperSurv")
dat <- metabric[1:30, ]
x_cols <- grep("^x", names(dat))[1:3]
X <- dat[, x_cols, drop = FALSE]
newX <- X[1:5, , drop = FALSE]
times <- seq(50, 150, by = 50)

fit <- surv.lognormal(
  time = dat$duration,
  event = dat$event,
  X = X,
  newdata = newX,
  new.times = times,
  obsWeights = rep(1, nrow(dat)),
  id = NULL
)

dim(fit$pred)
#> [1] 5 3
```

  time,
  event,
  X,

  alpha = 0.5,

\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric vector of observed follow-up times.}

\item{event}{Numeric vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 = censored).}

\item{X}{Training covariate data.frame or matrix.}

\item{obsWeights}{Numeric vector of observation weights.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric penalty exponent for \code{glmnet}. Defaults to 0.5 (Elastic Net).}

\item{minscreen}{Integer. Minimum number of covariates to return. Defaults to 2.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation. Defaults to 10.}

\item{nlambda}{Integer. Number of penalty parameters to search over. Defaults to 100.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{screen.glmnet}.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as the number of columns in \code{X},
indicating which variables passed the screening algorithm (\code{TRUE} to keep,
\code{FALSE} to drop).
}
\description{
This screening algorithm uses \code{\link[glmnet]{cv.glmnet}} to select covariates.
Unlike LASSO (\code{alpha = 1}), which drops correlated features, Elastic Net
(\code{alpha = 0.5} by default) shrinks correlated groups of features together,
making it ideal for selecting entire biological pathways.

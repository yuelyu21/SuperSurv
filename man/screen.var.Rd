\title{High Variance Screening Algorithm (Unsupervised)}
\usage{
screen.var(time, event, X, obsWeights, keep_fraction = 0.5, minscreen = 2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric vector of observed follow-up times (Ignored internally).}

\item{event}{Numeric vector of event indicators (Ignored internally).}

\item{X}{Training covariate data.frame or matrix.}

\item{obsWeights}{Numeric vector of observation weights (Ignored internally).}

\item{keep_fraction}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. The fraction of highest-variance
features to retain. Defaults to 0.5 (keeps the top 50\%).}

\item{minscreen}{Integer. Minimum number of covariates to return. Defaults to 2.}

\item{...}{Additional ignored arguments.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as the number of columns in \code{X},
indicating which variables passed the screening algorithm (\code{TRUE} to keep,
\code{FALSE} to drop).
}
\description{
An unsupervised screening algorithm that filters out low-variance features.
This is particularly useful for high-dimensional genomic or transcriptomic data
where many features remain relatively constant across all observations.
